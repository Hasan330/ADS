# Introduction to the course of ADS
A comprehensive 8-day training program for hands-on introduction to big data, data science, and machine learning models, methods and algorithms.

The workshop will take participants through the conceptual and applied foundations of the subject. Topics covered include:

Data Science techniques, models, methods and best practices.
Machine Learning theory, types of learning, and models
Practical examples of applying most frequently used Machine Learning industry models
Labs are developed to practically learn how to use the R and Python programming languages and packages for applying the main concepts and techniques of data science and machine learning.

The Workshop will provide participants with an applied introduction to data science industry practices and models of machine learning. The workshop has a strong focus on gaining hands-on experience implementing algorithms and building predictive models on real datasets. By the end of the workshop, participants will be ready to implement the machine learning algorithms using data science on their own data, and immediately generate business value.
## Data Science Overview
we will begin the session by revising the key elements and topics which have been introduced in the DATA SCIENCE FUNDEMINTALS (DSF) workshop, new registerd participant are encorged to take and study material provided in the given link [DATA SCIENCE FUNDEMNTALS](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/DSF)

The workshop will start by showing you the entire process for data science projects and the different roles and skills that are needed. Then the basics of obtaining data through a variety of sources are introduced to you, including web APIs and page scraping.
   
## Introduction to R¶
R is rapidly becoming the leading language in data science and statistics. Today, R is the tool of choice for data science professionals in every industry and field. Whether you are full-time number cruncher, or just the occasional data analyst, R will suit your needs.
during this session you wil you start working on the basics of R. In seven sections, you will cover its basic syntax, making you ready to undertake your own first data analysis using R. Starting from variables and basic operations, you will eventually learn how to handle data structures such as vectors, matrices, data frames and lists. In the final section, you will dive deeper into the graphical capabilities of R, and create your own stunning data visualizations. No prior knowledge in programming or data science is required.

### What you'll learn
* Introductory R language fundamentals and basic syntax
* What R is and how it’s used to perform data analysis
* Become familiar with the major R data structures
